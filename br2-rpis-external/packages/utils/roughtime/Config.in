		tlsdate: secure parasitic rdate replacement

		tlsdate sets the local clock by securely connecting with TLS to remote
		servers and extracting the remote time out of the secure handshake. Unlike
		ntpdate, tlsdate uses TCP, for instance connecting to a remote HTTPS or TLS
		enabled service, and provides some protection against adversaries that try to
		feed you malicious time information.
