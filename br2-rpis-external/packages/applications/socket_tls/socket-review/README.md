### Exercise 0 (Sockets Review)

This exercise is scientifically designed to induce PTSD to any of you who took an intro Operating Systems course in C.

The key points to get from this are to remember the flow of how you set up a basic server and client, in C, using TCP sockets. We've skipped over doing anything like poll() or DNS resolution in this example to just stick to the basics.

Compile it, run it, change what the server says, and if you like, make the client send something back.

Key takeaways from this are remembering how read() and write() work on sockets and how we check for
errors.
